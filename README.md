# Image fusion using guided filtering

## Dependencies
We make extensive use of the library **opencv** for python 
and its extended version **opencv-contrib** which include the guided filtering code.
Both libraries can be installed using pip: 

```
$pip install opencv-python
$pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
